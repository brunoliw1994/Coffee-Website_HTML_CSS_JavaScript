# Coffee-Website 

This project is part of one of my bootcamp projects that helped me to deepen my understanding of front-end web development. Through this build, I aimed to practice integrating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap in a responsive, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing web application. My goal is to gain real-world skills that simulate what is expected in a professional software development environment.

**Rexbrew Coffee** is a responsive coffee shop website that allows users to explore the menu, learn more about the business, and make dine-in reservations. Visitors can easily input their information, choose a time and date, and receive a confirmation, which they can print or (future feature) send via SMS or email. The homepage also includes a coffee image carousel for a richer browsing experience.

This project helped me reinforce skills in responsive design, DOM manipulation, and user interaction through forms and dynamic content display.
