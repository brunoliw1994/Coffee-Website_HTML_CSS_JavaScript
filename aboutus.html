    <h1 class="text-center mb-4">About Rexbrew Coffee</h1>
    <p class="lead text-center">
      Rexbrew Coffee was born from a simple yet powerful love for coffee. In the heart of Rexburg, three lifelong friends
      decided to transform their passion into a community-driven experience. It all started in a garage with a French press,
      a dream, and countless late-night brewing experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal wasn’t just to make coffee—we wanted to create a space where people could slow down, connect, and savor life’s
      moments over a perfectly brewed cup. We spent months sourcing the best beans, testing roasts, and learning the art of
      espresso. Eventually, Rexbrew Coffee was established as more than just a shop—it became a second home to students,
      locals, and travelers alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Rexbrew is a vibrant coffee community rooted in values of quality, warmth, and authenticity. From pour-overs to
      pastries, every item is crafted with care. We’re proud to support local farmers and sustainable practices, ensuring
      that your coffee journey is as ethical as it is enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're a coffee aficionado or just looking for a cozy place to study, we invite you to experience the warmth
      and hospitality of Rexbrew Coffee. Because to us, every cup is an opportunity to connect.
